# South American Borrowing - Database and Software
## Installation and Workflow for sabor

0. [Optional] PRE-INSTALLATION

Create virtual environment.  
We use <cite>conda</cite> for managing virtual environments.


```
% conda create -n testsabor python=3  
% conda activate testsabor  
```

1. INSTALL SABOR ===
- Copy zip file of sabor to local directory.
- [Optional] Rename unzipped folder to sabor.  

Make sabor your working directory.  
`% cd sabor`  

Install requirements.  
`% pip install -r requirements.txt`  

Install sabor. Developer version for commands access.  
`% pip install -e .`  

Install the datafiles for IDS and WOLD.  
`% cldfbench download lexibank_sabor.py`  

Construct the Sabor datafile and activate Sabor commands.  
`% cldfbench lexibank.makecldf lexibank_sabor.py`  

Check for access to commands.  
`% cldfbench --help`  
It should show the available sabor commands with prefix `sabor`.  



2. [Optional] SPLIT DATA ===

Optionally run Splits to create train and test datasets for cross validation.
Note, that if you do not change the folder to other than splits, 
this will overwrite cross-validation datasets used in our analysis and 
you will not be able to precisely duplicate paper results.

You can get help on the arguments for each command with the â€”help argument.  
`% cldfbench sabor.splitdata --help`  
`usage: cldfbench sabor.splitdata [-h] [--k K] [--folder FOLDER] [--test]`  
```
Partition wordlists into k-fold train and test files for use in cross-validations.  

options:  
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit  
  --k K            Partition factor k to use for cross-validation. (default: 10)  
  --folder FOLDER  Folder to store train-test splits for k-fold cross-validations. (default: splits)  
  --test           Demonstrate loading of train-test datasets in sequence. (default: False)
```  

Perform the 10-fold split as in the paper, but store into a different folder. Save the output!  
`% cldfbench sabor.splitdata --k 10 --folder splits-new >> output/Split-data-10-fold.txt`  



3. PERFORM CLOSEST MATCH BORROWING DETECTION ===

Analyze complete sabor dataset for closest match using SCA alignment method.  
Add `--label` argument to qualify the stored wordlist filename.  

```
% cldfbench sabor.closest --function sca --label "All-data"  
INFO    Construct closest from SaBor database.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function closest_match_sca_global  
INFO    Best: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.789  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
<store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  

Analyze train dataset and infer to test dataset for closest match using SCA alignment method.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.closest --function sca --label "Fold-00-data"\  
--file splits/CV10-fold-00-train.tsv --testfile splits/CV10-fold-00-test.tsv  
INFO    Construct closest from splits/CV10-fold-00-train.tsv.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function closest_match_sca_global  

INFO    Best: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.790  
[INFO] Data has been written to file </store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-train.tsv>.  
INFO    Test closest from splits/CV10-fold-00-test.tsv.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function closest_match_sca_global                           
INFO    Best: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.790  
INFO    Test: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.788  
[INFO] Data has been written to file   <store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-test.tsv>.
```  

We can evaluate language recipient details and overall performance as well as write out wordlist for diagnosis of errors for just the test dataset.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.evaluate  
>> --file store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-test.tsv  
>>   output/CM-evaluate-sca_global_fold-00-test.txt  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
<store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-test-evaluate.tsv>.  
```  


Analyze complete sabor dataset for closest match using edit distance method.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.closest --function ned --label "All-data"  
INFO    Construct closest from SaBor database.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function edit_distance  
INFO    Best: threshold 0.65, F1 score 0.765  
[INFO] Data has been written to file <store/CM-sp-predict-edit_distance-0.65-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  


4. PERFORM COGNATE BASED BORROWING DETECTION ===

All previous options to label output, perform train and test steps, evaluate language details are still available.  

With SCA distance function.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.cognate --method sca --label "All-data"  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function cognate_based_cognate_sca_global  
INFO    Best: threshold 0.46, F1 score 0.786  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
</sabor/store/CB-sp-predict-cognate_based_cognate_sca_global-0.46-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  

With edit distance function.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.cognate --method ned --label "All-data"  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function cognate_based_cognate_ned                           
INFO    Best: threshold 0.66, F1 score 0.774  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
</sabor/store/CB-sp-predict-cognate_based_cognate_ned-0.66-All-data-train.tsv>  
```  

5. PERFORM CLASSIFIER BASED BORROWING DETECTION ===

All previous options to label output, perform train and test steps, evaluate language details are still available.  

Default is both edit distance and SCA alignment methods together with 1-hot encoding of recipient language.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.classifier  --label "All-data"  
INFO    Construct classifier from SaBor database.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], functions ['sca', 'ned']  
INFO    Train: F1 score 0.810  
[INFO] Data has been written to file </store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  

Access to turn off 1-hot coding for language is not available from the command line.  


6. EVALUATE LANGUAGE DETAILS ===

Evaluate writes results to output as well as an evaluation wordlist to the store folder.  
Here we redirect output to the output folder.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.evaluate --file store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train.tsv >>  
output/CL-evaluate-All-data-train.txt  
[INFO] Data has been written to file <store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train-evaluate.tsv>.  
```  

We could of course output directly to the terminal.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.evaluate --file store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train.tsv  
```

This evaluation file may be inspected to help diagnose what are the errors in borrowing detection.


7. CROSS-VALIDATION ===

Perform 10 fold cross-validations for closest match, cognate based and classifier systems.  
Redirect output to the output folder.  

Closest match:  
```
% cldfbench sabor.crossvalidate 10 --method cm_sca >> output/Closest-cross-validate-10fold.txt  
INFO    10-fold cross-validation on splits directory using closest_match_sca_global.  

% cldfbench sabor.crossvalidate 10 --method cm_ned >> output/Closest-cross-validate-10fold.txt  
INFO    10-fold cross-validation on splits directory using edit_distance.  
```  

Cognate based:  
```
% cldfbench sabor.crossvalidate 10 --method cb_sca >> output/Cognate-cross-validate-10fold.txt  

% cldfbench sabor.crossvalidate 10 --method cb_ned >> output/Cognate-cross-validate-10fold.txt  
```  

Classifier:  
Cl_simple includes both edit distance and SCA methods.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.crossvalidate 10 --method cl_simple >>  
output/Classifier-cross-validate-10fold.txt  
INFO    10-fold cross-validation on splits directory using classifier_based_linear_svm_simple.   
```  

No_props drops the 1-hot encoding of recipient language for the same analysis.  
```
% cldfbench sabor.crossvalidate 10 --method cl_simple_no_props >>  
output/Classifier-cross-validate-10fold.txt  
INFO    10-fold cross-validation on splits directory using  
classifier_based_linear_svm_simple_no_props.  
```
