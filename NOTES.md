### Installation and Workflow for the Methods described in Miller and List (2023)

#### 1 Prepare Data and Code

Create virtual environment.  
We use <cite>conda</cite> for managing virtual environments.

```
% conda create -n testsabor python=3  
% conda activate testsabor  
```

With the Python virtualenvwrapper, you can simply write:

```
$ mkvirtualenv sabor
```



#### 2 Install the SaBor Package

We recommend handling data with GIT:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lexibank/sabor
$ cd sabor
$ git checkout v1.0.0
```

Install requirements using PIP:  

```
$ pip install -e .
```  

#### 3 Convert Data to CLDF (Optional)

Download the IDS and WOLD data using the freshly installed `cldfbench` command:

```
$ cldfbench download lexibank_sabor.py  
```

Convert the data to CLDF: Make sure to initially clone [Glottolog](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog), [Concepticon](https://github.com/concepticon/concepticon-data) and [CLTS](https://github.com/cldf-clts/clts) in a directory or directories of your choice. You will need to point to them in your command (we assume they are located one directory upwards in your directory tree)/

```
$ cldfbench lexibank.makecldf lexibank_sabor.py --glottolog=../glottolog --concepticon=../concepticon-data --clts=../clts --glottolog-version=v4.7 --concepticon-version=v3.0.0 --clts-version=v2.2.0
```

Check for access to commands.
 
```
$ cldfbench --help
```

The final lines should output the following lines:

```
    sabor.classifier    Borrowings by Classifier
    sabor.closest       Simple Donor Search based on pairwise sequence comparison.
    sabor.cognate       Borrowings by donor words detected as cognates.
    sabor.crossvalidate
                        Given a constructor function for an analysis method, perform
    sabor.evaluate      Evaluate data.
    sabor.splitdata     Partition wordlists into k-fold train and test files for use in cross-validations.
```  

#### 4 Split Data into Test and Training Data (Optional)

Optionally run the `sabor.splitdata` subcommand in `cldfbench` to 
create train and test datasets for cross validation.
Note, that if you do not change the folder to other than splits, 
this will overwrite cross-validation datasets used in our analysis and 
you will not be able to precisely duplicate paper results.

You can get help on the arguments for each command with the â€”help argument.  
```
$ cldfbench sabor.splitdata --help 
usage: cldfbench sabor.splitdata [-h] [--k K] [--folder FOLDER] [--test]

Partition wordlists into k-fold train and test files for use in cross-validations.  

options:  
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit  
  --k K            Partition factor k to use for cross-validation. (default: 10)  
  --folder FOLDER  Folder to store train-test splits for k-fold cross-validations. (default: splits)  
  --test           Demonstrate loading of train-test datasets in sequence. (default: False)
```  

Perform the 10-fold split as in the paper, but store into a different folder. Save the output!  

```
$ cldfbench sabor.splitdata --k 10 --folder splits-new >> output/Split-data-10-fold.txt`  
```


#### 5 Perform Closest Match Borrowing Detection

Analyze complete sabor dataset for closest match using SCA alignment method.  
Add `--label` argument to qualify the stored wordlist filename.  

```
$ cldfbench sabor.closest --function sca --label "All-data"  
INFO    Construct closest from SaBor database.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function closest_match_sca_global  
INFO    Best: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.789  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
<store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  

Analyze train dataset and infer to test dataset for closest match using SCA alignment method.  

```
$ cldfbench sabor.closest --function sca --label "Fold-00-data" --file splits/CV10-fold-00-train.tsv --testfile splits/CV10-fold-00-test.tsv  
INFO    Construct closest from splits/CV10-fold-00-train.tsv.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function closest_match_sca_global  

INFO    Best: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.790  
[INFO] Data has been written to file </store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-train.tsv>.  
INFO    Test closest from splits/CV10-fold-00-test.tsv.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function closest_match_sca_global                           
INFO    Best: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.790  
INFO    Test: threshold 0.40, F1 score 0.788  
[INFO] Data has been written to file   <store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-test.tsv>.
```  

We can evaluate language recipient details and overall performance as well as write out wordlist for diagnosis of errors for just the test dataset.  

```
$ cldfbench sabor.evaluate  --file store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-test.tsv >> output/CM-evaluate-sca_global_fold-00-test.txt  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
<store/CM-sp-predict-closest_match_sca_global-0.40-Fold-00-data-test-evaluate.tsv>.  
```  


Analyze complete sabor dataset for closest match using edit distance method.  
```
$ cldfbench sabor.closest --function ned --label "All-data"  
INFO    Construct closest from SaBor database.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function edit_distance  
INFO    Best: threshold 0.65, F1 score 0.765  
[INFO] Data has been written to file <store/CM-sp-predict-edit_distance-0.65-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  


#### 6 Perform Cognate-Based Borrowing Detection

All previous options to label output, perform train and test steps, evaluate language details are still available.  

With SCA distance function.  
```
$ cldfbench sabor.cognate --method sca --label "All-data"  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function cognate_based_cognate_sca_global  
INFO    Best: threshold 0.46, F1 score 0.786  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
</sabor/store/CB-sp-predict-cognate_based_cognate_sca_global-0.46-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  

With edit distance function.  
```
$ cldfbench sabor.cognate --method ned --label "All-data"  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function cognate_based_cognate_ned                           
INFO    Best: threshold 0.66, F1 score 0.774  
[INFO] Data has been written to file  
</sabor/store/CB-sp-predict-cognate_based_cognate_ned-0.66-All-data-train.tsv>  
```  

For specific train and test files.  
```
$ cldfbench sabor.cognate --file splits/CV10-fold-00-train.tsv --testfile splits/CV10-fold-00-test.tsv --label "cognate based train-test"
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], function cognate_based_cognate_sca_global                                                   
INFO    Best: threshold 0.46, F1 score 0.786
INFO    Test: threshold 0.46, F1 score 0.782
2023-01-26 19:59:27,835 [INFO] Data has been written to file </sabor/store/CB-sp-predict-cognate_based_cognate_sca_global-0.46-cognate based train-test-test.tsv>.
```

#### 7 Perform Classifier-Based Borrowing Detection

All previous options to label output, perform train and test steps, evaluate language details are still available.  

Default is both edit distance and SCA alignment methods together with 1-hot encoding of recipient language.  
```
$ cldfbench sabor.classifier  --label "All-data"  
INFO    Construct classifier from SaBor database.  
INFO    Trained with donors ['Spanish'], functions ['sca', 'ned']  
INFO    Train: F1 score 0.810  
[INFO] Data has been written to file </store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train.tsv>.  
```  

Access to turn off 1-hot coding for language is not available from the command line.  


#### 8 Evaluate Language Details

Evaluate writes results to output as well as an evaluation wordlist to the store folder.  
Here we redirect output to the output folder.  

```
$ cldfbench sabor.evaluate --file store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train.tsv >> output/CL-evaluate-All-data-train.txt  
[INFO] Data has been written to file <store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train-evaluate.tsv>.  
```  

We could of course output directly to the terminal.  
```
$ cldfbench sabor.evaluate --file store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train.tsv  
```  

```
Detection results for: store/CL-sp-predict-linear_svm-All-data-train.tsv.
